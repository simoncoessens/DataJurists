**Context**
Defining what constitutes an AI system can sometimes be tricky. The European
Union has opted to align with an international definition, aiming to distinguish AI
systems from traditional software. The EU AI Act focuses on two primary targets:
AI systems and General Purpose AI (GPAI) models.
An AI system is characterized by the following features:
**Autonomy**: Itâ€™s designed to operate with varying degrees of independence.
**Adaptability**: The system may show adaptive behavior after deployment,
working towards explicit or implicit objectives.
**Inference**: It processes input to generate outputs like predictions, content,
recommendations, or decisions.
**Impact**: These outputs can affect physical or virtual environments.
A General Purpose AI (GPAI) model, on the other hand, has these characteristics:
It demonstrates significant generality.
It can competently perform a wide variety of tasks,
It can be integrated into various downstream systems or applications.
