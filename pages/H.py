To avoid overburdening, the AI Act narrows the scope of what qualifies as a high-risk AI system when it doesnâ€™t pose a significant risk to health, safety, or fundamental rights.

For example, if your AI system is intended to perform profiling of natural persons or influences decision-making outcomes, it may pose a significant risk. However, ANNA can guide you in determining if your AI system falls under this exception, which could reduce the regulatory burden on you.
